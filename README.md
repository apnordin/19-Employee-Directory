# React- Employee Directory

## Description

The purpose of this application was to build a mock employee directory from scratch using React. I broke up my application's UI into three components and 5 states.

When the user loads the page, a table of employees renders from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/). The user can sort the table by the "name" category, which actually sorts by the user's last name (either alphabetically or reverse-alphabetically).

The user can also filter the users by typing into the search bar. My app uses the [Fuzzy Search NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fuzzy-search) to power the search function. As the user types into the searchbar, the table of employees gets smaller as the search criteria gets more specific. As the user relaxes the search, the table re-populates with the full list of employees.

You can find the deployed application [here](https://apnordin.github.io/19-Employee-Directory/).
